# NPM Package Name Reservation

> [!NOTE]
> These instructions are for reserving the npm package name `mcp-knowledge-base` with a minimal placeholder package.

## Steps to Reserve Package Name

### 1. Create Minimal Project Structure

```bash
mkdir mcp-knowledge-base
cd mcp-knowledge-base
```

### 2. Initialize Package

```bash
npm init -y
```

### 3. Update package.json

```json
{
  "name": "mcp-knowledge-base",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "MCP server for knowledge base functionality - Coming Soon",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "mcp",
    "claude",
    "knowledge-base",
    "ai"
  ],
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

### 4. Create Minimal index.js

```javascript
console.log('MCP Knowledge Base - Coming Soon');
```

### 5. Create README.md

```markdown
# MCP Knowledge Base

> [!NOTE]
> This package is currently in development. Future versions will provide knowledge base functionality for Claude AI.

## Coming Soon

This package will build upon mcp-knowledge-graph to provide:
- Enhanced knowledge base capabilities
- Improved memory management
- Advanced querying features

## Status

This is a placeholder release. Production version coming soon.
```

### 6. Publish Placeholder

```bash
npm login  # if not already logged in
npm publish
```

## Important Notes

1. Version Strategy
   - Start with 0.0.1 for placeholder
   - Use 0.x.x for development versions
   - Release 1.0.0 when ready for production

2. Package Maintenance
   - Update placeholder occasionally to maintain npm listing
   - Add "under development" notices in README
   - Consider adding GitHub repository with roadmap

3. Name Protection
   - Publishing placeholder prevents name squatting
   - Establishes your ownership of the name
   - Allows time for proper development

4. Future Updates
   - When ready to develop, use same package name
   - Increment version appropriately
   - Update with actual functionality

## Verification

After publishing, verify reservation:

```bash
npm view mcp-knowledge-base
```

## Cleanup When Ready

When ready to develop the actual package:

1. Archive placeholder code
2. Start development in new repository
3. Maintain same package name
4. Update version to reflect development status
